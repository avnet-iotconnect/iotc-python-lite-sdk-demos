# 2. Requirements
This guide has been written and tested to work on a Windows 10/11 PC. However, there is no reason this can't be replicated in other environments.

## Hardware 
* Microchip ATSAMA5D27-SOM1-EK [Purchase](https://www.avnet.com/shop/us/products/microchip/atsama5d27-som1-ek-3074457345633909354/?srsltid=AfmBOorYtSqVK7BDtS-_h4NDc21QKb7yCg1XAcTrRP8ydEuLJZFjeglj) | [User Manual & Kit Contents](https://onlinedocs.microchip.com/oxy/GUID-4F28D8A1-1A8D-4973-B7C3-4F63D191E011-en-US-4/index.html) | [All Resources](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/atsama5d27-som1-ek1)
* Ethernet Cable
* Micro-USB Cable (included in kit)
* Standard SD Card (or Micro-SD Card with Standard-Size Adapter)

## Software
* A serial terminal such as [TeraTerm](https://github.com/TeraTermProject/teraterm/releases) or [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/)
* Flash Yocto Image to SD Card:
  1. [Click here](https://www.linux4sam.org/bin/view/Linux4SAM/Sama5d27Som1EKMainPage#eMMC_support_on_SDMMC0) to get to the page to download the latest image for the SAMA5D27.
  2. Download the image (link may have updated name that slightly differs from screenshot):

    <img src=".//media/image-download.png" alt="Yocto Image Download"/>

  3. Follow the "Create a SD card with the demo" section of the instructions to flash the image to an SD card.


# 3. Hardware Setup
See the reference image below for cable connections.
<details>
<summary>Reference Image with Connections</summary>
<img src="./media/sama5d27_board_setup.png" width="600">
</details>

Using the above image as reference, make the following connections:
1. Connect the included micro-USB cable from your PC to the connector labeled **#1**.
2. Connect an Ethernet cable from your LAN (router/switch) to the Ethernet connector labeled **#2**.
3. Insert the SD card (or Micro-SD card with an adapter) into the slot labeled **#3**.

# 4. /IOTCONNECT: Cloud Account Setup
An /IOTCONNECT account with AWS backend is required.  If you need to create an account, a free trial subscription is available.
The free subscription may be obtained directly from iotconnect.io or through the AWS Marketplace.


* Option #1 (Recommended) [/IOTCONNECT via AWS Marketplace](https://github.com/avnet-iotconnect/avnet-iotconnect.github.io/blob/main/documentation/iotconnect/subscription/iotconnect_aws_marketplace.md) - 60 day trial; AWS account creation required
* Option #2 [/IOTCONNECT via iotconnect.io](https://subscription.iotconnect.io/subscribe?cloud=aws) - 30 day trial; no credit card required


> [!NOTE]
> Be sure to check any SPAM folder for the temporary password after registering.

# 5. Device Setup
1. Open a serial terminal emulator program such as TeraTerm.
2. Ensure that your serial settings in your terminal emulator are set to:
  - Baud Rate: 115200
  - Data Bits: 8
  - Stop Bits: 1
  - Parity: None
3. Noting the COM port value for "JLink CDC UART Port" in the Device Manager list, attempt to connect to your board via the terminal emulator
>[!NOTE]
>A successful connection may result in just a blank terminal box. If you see a blank terminal box, press the ENTER key to get a login prompt. An unsuccessful connection attempt will usually result in an error window popping up.
4. When prompted for a login, type `root` followed by the ENTER key.
5. Run these commands to update the core board packages and install necessary /IOTCONNECT packages:
```
sudo apt-get update
```
```
sudo apt-get install python3-pip -y
```
```
python3 -m pip install iotconnect-sdk-lite requests
```
6. Then run these commands to create and move into a directory for your demo files:
```
mkdir -p /home/weston/demo && cd /home/weston/demo
```

>[!TIP]
>To gain access to "copy" and "paste" functions inside of a Putty terminal window, you can CTRL+RIGHTCLICK within the 
> window to utilize a dropdown menu with these commands. This is very helpful for copying/pasting between your browser 
> and the terminal.

# 6. Onboard Device

The next step is to onboard your device into /IOTCONNECT. This will be done via the online /IOTCONNECT user interface.

Follow [this guide](../common/general-guides/UI-ONBOARD.md) to walk you through the process.

> [!TIP]
> If you have obtained a solution key for your /IOTCONNECT account from Softweb Solutions, you can utilize the /IOTCONNECT 
> REST API to automate the device onboarding process via shell scripts. Check out [this guide](../common/general-guides/REST-API-ONBOARD.md) 
> for more info on that.
    
# 7. Using the Demo

Run the basic demo with this command:

```
python3 app.py
```

> [!NOTE]
> Always make sure you are in the ```/home/weston/demo``` directory before running the demo. You can move to this
> directory with the command: ```cd /home/weston/demo```

View the random-integer telemetry data under the "Live Data" tab for your device on /IOTCONNECT.
