# /IOTCONNECT Starter Demo: Package Creation and Deployment

This guide will help you create and deliver a package based on the /IOTCONNECT Starter Demo to the Tria Vision AI-KIT 6490.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have not yet followed
> the [/IOTCONNECT quickstart guide for this board](https://github.com/avnet-iotconnect/iotc-python-lite-sdk-demos/blob/main/tria-vision-ai-kit-6490/README.md),
> complete that first and then return here to pick up on Step 1.

## 1. Clone This Git Repository to Your Host Machine

Clone a copy of this repo to your local PC. This is where you will make changes/additions to the demo files.
> [!NOTE]
> On a Linux machine this can simply be done in the terminal, but a Windows host machine will require Git Bash or WSL.

## 2. Customize Package

Inside of the cloned repo (```iotc-python-lite-sdk-demos```), navigate to the
```tria-vision-ai-kit-6490/starter-demo/src/``` directory:

```
cd ./tria-vision-ai-kit-6490/starter-demo/src/
```

By default, this directory contains the basic starter ```app.py``` and a starter ```install.sh``` script.

If you want to make a modification to ```app.py```, do that now. If you are not modifying ```app.py``` in this package,
you may delete it from the directory.

If you wish to add more source files to the package, copy them into the ```src``` directory.

If the device will need to perform some actions (move files, install libraries, etc.) after the package is received,
modify ```install.sh``` to perform those actions. It will be automatically executed after the package is received and
extracted on the device.

## 3. Create Package

Navigate back to the ```starter-demo``` directory and then run this command to create ```package.tar.gz``` which
includes the necessary demo files and installation script:

```
bash ./create-package.sh
```

> [!NOTE]
> At the end of the package creation script, ```package.tar.gz``` is automatically copied into the ```common```
> directory so it can be readily accessed by the scripts used in optional steps 5B and 5C.

## 4. Prepare Device to Receive Package

The most basic way to deliver and run the install package is through a local file transfer. See step 5A below for
instructions on this method.

For your board to receive the package through /IOTCONNECT, it must be actively connected. Do this by running the main
/IOTCONNECT program on your board called ```app.py```:

Alternatively you could deliver the install package through the online /IOTCONNECT platform as an OTA (see step 5B)

## 5A. Deliver Package Through Local File Transfer

To deliver your package to a device through a local file transfer, the recommended method is to use an ```scp``` (secure
copy) command.

First find the active IP address of your device and then use that IP address to copy ```package.tar.gz``` into the main
application directory of the device (```/home/weston/demo```).

After the file transfer is complete, open a terminal on your device, navigate to the main application directory, and
verify that there is a ```package.tar.gz``` present.

If ```package.tar.gz``` is there, run this command to decompress the file and overwrite existing files in the directory:

```
tar -xzf package.tar.gz --overwrite
```

Lastly, execute the ```install.sh``` script to perform any additional file movements/modifications that you programmed
into your install package:

```
bash ./install.sh
```

## 5B. Upload and Push Package Through OTA in /IOTCONNECT Online Platform

1) In the "Device" Page of the online /IOTCONNECT platform, on the blue toolbar at the bottom of the page select "
   Firmware"
2) If a firmware has already been created for your device's template, skip to step 3. Otherwise:
    * Select the blue "Create Firmware" button in the top-right of the screen
    * Name your firmware (remember this name for later)
    * Select your device's template from the "Template" drop-down (if your device's template is not in the list, a
      firmware for it already exists in your /IOTCONNECT instance)
    * Enter hardware and software version numbers (can be arbitrary such as 0, 0)
    * Select the "Browse" button in the "File" section and select your ```package.tar.gz```
    * Add descriptions if you desire
    * Select the "Save" button
3) Navigate back to the Firmware page and find your new firmware name in the list
4) Under the "Draft" column within the "Software Upgrades" column, click on the draft number (will be "1" for
   newly-created firmwares)
5) Select the black square with the black arrow under "Actions" to publish your firmware and make it available for OTA
6) In the "Firmware" page of /IOTCONNECT, select the "OTA Updates" button in the top-right of the screen
7) For "Hardware Version" select your firmware's name with the hyphenated hardware version from the drop-down
8) Select the software version you chose for your firmware
9) For "Target" select "Devices" from the drop-down
10) Select your device's unique ID from the "Devices" drop-down
11) Click the blue "Update" button to initialize the OTA update

## 6. View Update in Device Console

Shortly after sending the update via any method, you should see an interruption in the telemetry printout on the console
of your device informing you that an update package was received, downloaded and executed.

The program is designed to re-start itself after the update files have been automatically decompressed and the
```install.sh``` script is executed (if included). There is no need for you to do any manual reboots or file
manipulation. Your package installation is complete and the program is working again already!
