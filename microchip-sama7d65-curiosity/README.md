# 2. Requirements

This guide has been written and tested to work on a Windows 10/11 PC. However, there is no reason this can't be
replicated in other environments.

## Hardware

> [!NOTE]
> The USB to TTL Serial 3.3V Adapter Cable may require you to install a specific driver onto your host machine. The
> example cable linked above requires
> a [PL2303 driver](https://www.prolific.com.tw/us/showproduct.aspx?p_id=225&pcid=41).

## Software

* A serial terminal such as [TeraTerm](https://github.com/TeraTermProject/teraterm/releases)
  or [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/)
* Flash Yocto Image to SD Card:
    1. [Click here](https://developerhelp.microchip.com/xwiki/bin/view/applications/linux4sam/Boards/sama7d65curosity/#HDemoarchives)
       to get to the page to download the latest image for the SAMA7D65.
    2. Download the image (link may have updated name that slightly differs from screenshot):

    <img src=".//media/image-download.png" alt="Yocto Image Download"/>

    3. Follow the "Create a SD card with the demo" section of the instructions to flash the image to an SD card.

# 3. Hardware Setup

See the reference image below for cable connections.
<details>
<summary>Reference Image with Connections</summary>
<img src="./media/board-connections.png" width="600">
</details>

Using the above image as reference, make the following connections:

1. Connect the included USB-C cable from your PC to the USB-C connector labeled **#1**.
2. Connect an Ethernet cable from your LAN (router/switch) to the Ethernet connector labeled **#2**.
3. Insert the SD card (or micro-SD card with an adapter) into the slot labeled **#3**.
4. Connect your USB to TTL Serial 3.3V Adapter Cable to the appropriate pins on the J35 debug header labeled **#4**.

J35 Pinout: GND - OPEN - OPEN - RX - TX - OPEN

Color-coded connections from suggested USB to TTL adapter cable: BLACK - OPEN - OPEN - WHITE - GREEN - OPEN

> [!NOTE]
> If your USB to TTL adapter cable has one larger connector (usually all 6 pins) instead of individual wires, that is
> still fine as long as the GND, RX, and TX pins line up correctly. It should also be noted that usually on USB to TTL
> adapters, **the RX female slot should line up with the TX pin on the board (and vice versa).** If you are unsure, try
> RX-to-TX and TX-to-RX first and if the serial connection does not work, then try RX-to-RX and TX-to-TX.

# 4. /IOTCONNECT: Cloud Account Setup

An /IOTCONNECT account with AWS backend is required. If you need to create an account, a free trial subscription is
available.
The free subscription may be obtained directly from iotconnect.io or through the AWS Marketplace.

* Option #1 (
  Recommended) [/IOTCONNECT via AWS Marketplace](https://github.com/avnet-iotconnect/avnet-iotconnect.github.io/blob/main/documentation/iotconnect/subscription/iotconnect_aws_marketplace.md) -
  60 day trial; AWS account creation required
* Option #2 [/IOTCONNECT via iotconnect.io](https://subscription.iotconnect.io/subscribe?cloud=aws) - 30 day trial; no
  credit card required

> [!NOTE]
> Be sure to check any SPAM folder for the temporary password after registering.

# 5. Device Setup

1. Open a serial terminal emulator program such as TeraTerm.
2. Ensure that your serial settings in your terminal emulator are set to:

- Baud Rate: 115200
- Data Bits: 8
- Stop Bits: 1
- Parity: None

3. Noting the new COM port in your Device Manager list, attempt to connect to your board via
   the terminal emulator

> [!NOTE]
> A successful connection may result in just a blank terminal box. If you see a blank terminal box, press the ENTER key
> to get a login prompt. An unsuccessful connection attempt will usually result in an error window popping up.

4. When prompted for a login, type `root` followed by the ENTER key.
5. Run these commands to update the core board packages and install necessary /IOTCONNECT packages:

```
sudo opkg update
```

```
python3 -m pip install iotconnect-sdk-lite requests
```

6. Then run these commands to create and move into a directory for your demo files:

```
mkdir -p /home/weston/demo && cd /home/weston/demo
```

> [!TIP]
> To gain access to "copy" and "paste" functions inside of a Putty terminal window, you can CTRL+RIGHTCLICK within the
> window to utilize a dropdown menu with these commands. This is very helpful for copying/pasting between your browser and
> the terminal.

# 6. Onboard Device

The next step is to onboard your device into /IOTCONNECT. This will be done via the online /IOTCONNECT user interface.

Follow [this guide](../common/general-guides/UI-ONBOARD.md) to walk you through the process.

> [!TIP]
> If you have obtained a solution key for your /IOTCONNECT account from Softweb Solutions, you can utilize the /IOTCONNECT 
> REST API to automate the device onboarding process via shell scripts. Check out [this guide](../common/general-guides/REST-API-ONBOARD.md) 
> for more info on that.

# 7. Using the Demo

Run the basic demo with this command:

```
python3 app.py
```

> [!NOTE]
> Always make sure you are in the ```/home/weston/demo``` directory before running the demo. You can move to this
> directory with the command: ```cd /home/weston/demo```

View the random-integer telemetry data under the "Live Data" tab for your device on /IOTCONNECT.
