> [!NOTE]
> The USB to TTL Serial 3.3V Adapter Cable may require you to install a specific driver onto your host machine. The
> example cable linked above requires a [PL2303 driver](https://www.prolific.com.tw/us/showproduct.aspx?p_id=225&pcid=41).

* Ethernet Cable (and a local router/switch with Internet connectivity)

## Software

* A serial terminal such as [TeraTerm](https://github.com/TeraTermProject/teraterm/releases)
  or [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/)

# 3. Hardware Setup

See the reference image below for cable connections.
<details>
<summary>Reference Image with Connections</summary>
<img src="./media/OSM-93-connections.png">
</details>

1. Connect an Ethernet cable from your LAN (router/switch) to the "ETH_A" port on the board.
2. Connect a USB-C cable from a 5V power source (such as your host machine) to the "POWER/USB_A" port on your board.
3. Connect your USB to TTL Serial 3.3V Adapter Cable to the appropriate pins on the A55 debug header.

> [!NOTE]
> The A55 debug header is the **lower** row of 3 pins, the upper row should be left open.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When connecting the wires of your USB to TTL Serial 3.3V Adapter Cable, the "TXD" pin of the board should connect to
> the "RXD" wire of your cable. Similarly, the "RXD" pin of the board should connect to the "TXD" wire of your cable. "
> GND" connects to "GND".

# 4. Cloud Account Setup

An /IOTCONNECT account with AWS backend is required. If you need to create an account, a free trial subscription is
available.
The free subscription may be obtained directly from iotconnect.io or through the AWS Marketplace.

* Option #1 (
  Recommended) [/IOTCONNECT via AWS Marketplace](https://github.com/avnet-iotconnect/avnet-iotconnect.github.io/blob/main/documentation/iotconnect/subscription/iotconnect_aws_marketplace.md) -
  60 day trial; AWS account creation required
* Option #2 [/IOTCONNECT via iotconnect.io](https://subscription.iotconnect.io/subscribe?cloud=aws) - 30 day trial; no
  credit card required

> [!NOTE]
> Be sure to check any SPAM folder for the temporary password after registering.

# 5. Device Setup

1. With the board powered on and connected to your host machine, open your Device Manager list and note the COM port
   being utilized by your adapter cable.

> [!TIP]
> If you do not see your cable in the COM port list, check for it in the "Other devices" section. You may need to
> install/select the driver for the cable to get it to be recognized as a COM port connection.

2. Open a terminal emulator program such as TeraTerm or PuTTY on your host machine.
3. Ensure that your serial settings in your terminal emulator are set to:

- Baud Rate: 115200
- Data Bits: 8
- Stop Bits: 1
- Parity: None

4. Use that COM port from sub-step 1 to connect to your board via the terminal emulator.

> [!NOTE]
> A successful connection may result in just a blank terminal box. If you see a blank terminal box, press the ENTER key
> to get a login prompt. An unsuccessful connection attempt will usually result in an error window popping up.

5. When prompted for a login, type `root` followed by the ENTER key.
6. Run these commands to begin to configure your board for /IOTCONNECT:

```
sudo apt-get update
```

```
python3 -m pip install iotconnect-sdk-lite requests
```

```
mkdir -p /home/weston/demo && cd /home/weston/demo
```

> [!TIP]
> To gain access to "copy" and "paste" functions inside of a PuTTY terminal window, you can CTRL+RIGHTCLICK within the
> window to utilize a dropdown menu with these commands. This is very helpful for copying/pasting between your browser and
> the terminal.

# 6. Onboard Device

The next step is to onboard your device into /IOTCONNECT. This will be done via the online /IOTCONNECT user interface.

Follow [this guide](../common/general-guides/UI-ONBOARD.md) to walk you through the process.

> [!TIP]
> If you have obtained a solution key for your /IOTCONNECT account from Softweb Solutions, you can utilize the /IOTCONNECT 
> REST API to automate the device onboarding process via shell scripts. Check out [this guide](../common/general-guides/REST-API-ONBOARD.md) 
> for more info on that.

# 7. Using the Demo

Run the basic demo with this command:

```
python3 app.py
```

> [!NOTE]
> Always make sure you are in the ```/home/weston/demo``` directory before running the demo. You can move to this
> directory with the command: ```cd /home/weston/demo```

View the random-integer telemetry data under the "Live Data" tab for your device on /IOTCONNECT.
