# Introduction
This repository contains guides and demos that utilize the [IoTConnect Python Lite SDK](https://github.com/avnet-iotconnect/iotc-python-lite-sdk)
to connect Linux devices to the Avnet IoTConnect platform 
and showcase basic telemetry reporting and C2D command receiving functionality.

Currently, each of the board demos follows the simple Python Lite SDK Quickstart Example and experience,
focusing on showcasing how to send and receive data over the network with IoTConnect with the SDK.

Check this page at a later date for demos that interact with IoTConnect, 
utilizing the hardware board-specific functionality.
