# Introduction

This repository contains various guides and demos that utilize
the [/IOTCONNECT Python Lite SDK](https://github.com/avnet-iotconnect/iotc-python-lite-sdk) to connect devices to the
Avnet /IOTCONNECT platform and showcase telemetry reporting and cloud-to-device command functionality.
The Python Lite SDK may be used to enable /IOTCONNECT on a wide variety of development boards/platforms. Avnet has
completed this work for a subset of board as outlined in the following section.

# Getting Started

To get started connecting your board to /IOTCONNECT, **first follow the Quickstart Guide within your board's specific
directory in this repository.** This guide will help you flash any required images, get access to your device's console,
and set up basic /IOTCONNECT onboarding for your device.

# AWS Greengrass Demos Enablement

To explore setting up AWS Greengrass Lite on some of these same devices and deploying python demos through pre-built or custom
components, check out the [/IOTCONNECT Python Greengrass Demos repo](https://github.com/avnet-iotconnect/iotc-python-greengrass-demos/tree/main).

# Further Customization

If you want to modify or add onto the basic /IOTCONNECT starter application, you can do so by sending a software package
to your device.

Within the directories for each device in this repository is a ```starter-demo``` directory with instructions on how to
do this.

Some devices also include directories for pre-built expansion demos such as
the [EIQ Vision AI Driver Monitoring System (DMS) Demo](nxp-frdm-imx-93/dms-demo) for the NXP FRDM i.MX 93. Inside of
the directories for those demos you will find instructions on how to use a software package to deliver and install the
pre-built demo.
