# How to Setup the MKBOXPRO Sensor Pack

Begin by powering your MKBOXPRO Sensor pack with 5VDC using a USB-C cable, and turning the power switch to the "ON"
position.

On a smartphone (IOS or Android), install the ST BLE Sensor App. Turn your phone's bluetooth on, and then open the app.
The MKBOXPRO module should be discovered under the name "BLEPnP". If not, refresh the page until it is.

If a firmware upgrade is available for your MKBOXPRO, you should be automatically prompted to flash the newly available
firmware. After it has finished flashing, reboot the MKBOXPRO and reconnect to it in the app to verify that the firmware
flash was successful.

Your MKBOXPRO should now be ready for use.
