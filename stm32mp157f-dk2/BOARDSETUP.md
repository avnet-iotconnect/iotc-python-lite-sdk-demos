## Step 1: Flash IoTConnect-Compatible Image to Board
* To download the zipped image folder, [click here](https://saleshosted.z13.web.core.windows.net/sdk/st/stmp1/proteus/OSTL_6.1_IoTConnect_Compatible.zip).
* Unzip the folder to a known location.
* Download and Install the [STM32CubeProgrammer](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html) software (the utility for flashing the image to the device).
   * You may have to create an ST account (it's free) to get access to the software download.
* Set up the STM32MP157F-DK board for flashing:
   * On the underside of the board, flip both of the large dipswitches (directly opposite of the HDMI port) to the "OFF" position.

   * Power the board with a USB-C cable connected to the "PWR_IN" USB-C port connected to a 5VDC supply with at least 1.0A of output.

   * Connect the USB-C "USB" port of your board to your PC with the included USB-C cable.
      * If your PC does not have a USB-C port, you may use a USB-A to USB-C cable and connect it to a normal USB-A port on your PC.

   * Insert the included SD card into the SD card slot on the board.
      
   * Push the "RESET" button on your board to ensure it boots into flashing mode (the LCD display of the board should be black when it has booted into flashing mode).

* Navigate to the directory where you have the unzipped "OpenSTLinux_IoTConnect_Compatible" folder, and then navigate through the folder to get to this directory: {Your preliminary directory}\OSTL_6.1_IoTConnect_Compatible\images\stm32mp1\flashlayout_st-image-weston\optee
   * Select the FlashLayout_sdcard_stm32mp157F-dk2-optee.tsv file and then click "Open."

* Navigate once again to the directory where you have the unzipped "OpenSTLinux_IoTConnect_Compatible" folder, and then navigate through the folder to get to this directory: {Your preliminary directory}\OSTL_6.1_IoTConnect_Compatible\images\stm32mp1
   * Select the stm32mp1 folder and then click "Select folder."

* Back in the STM32CubeProgrammer window, on the right-hand side of the screen, if the "Port" is listed as "No DFU...," make sure your USB cable is connected both to your PC and the board, and then click the revolving arrows icon.

* When the device is recognized by the software, the port listing will be "USB" followed by a number, such as 1. The serial number of your board should also be listed beneath the port name.

* You are ready to flash. Click the "Download" button to begin the flashing process.
   * The STM32MP157F-DK2 will turn off and on several times throughout the flashing process. It is important to not unplug or disturb it during the process. Given the size of the image it will usually take **up to 45 minutes** to flash.
   * It is worth noting that the LCD screen on the board will turn on with some output text during the flash process, so do not be alarmed.

* When the flash has completed successfully, this pop-up in the STM32CubeProgrammer window will appear.

* Now, flip the large dipswitches on the underside of your board both to the "ON" position, and once again hit the reset button to properly boot the new image from the SD card.

* **For the first boot after flashing, the board takes a few minutes to turn on.**

## Step 2: Serially Connect to the STM32MP157F-DK2

* Using a USB-A to micro-USB cable, connect your board to your PC at the CN11 ST-LINK connector.

* Check and note which COM port the board is utilizing
  * On Windows computers this can be seen by using the Device Manager
