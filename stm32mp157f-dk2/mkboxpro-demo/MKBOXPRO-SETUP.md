# How to Setup the MKBOXPRO Sensor Pack

Begin by powering your MKBOXPRO Sensor pack with 5VDC using a USB-C cable, and turning the power switch to the "ON" position.

To prepare your MKBOXPRO pack for the demo, you will need to make sure it is loaded with the correct firmware file (`BLESensorsPnPL.bin` available in this directory). Since the firmware flashing will be done from a smartphone, you will need to send and save this file to your smartphone (email is probably the easiest way). 

On a smartphone (IOS or Android), install the ST BLE Sensor App. Turn your phone's bluetooth on, and then open the app. The MKBOXPRO module should be discovered, likely under the name "BLEPnP." If not, refresh the page until it is.

After tapping on your MKBOXPRO in the device discovery screen, tap on the gear icon in the top-right of your screen, and then "Firmware Upgrade" in the resulting pop-up. Tap on the blue folder icon, select the `BLESensorsPnPL.bin` file, and then tap the "UPGRADE" button to flash the firmware.

After the flash has completed, the MKBOXPRO will automatically reboot and you can close out of the app on your phone.

Your MKBOXPRO should now be ready for use.
