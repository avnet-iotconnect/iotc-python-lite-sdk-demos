<details>
<summary>Reference Image with Connections</summary>
<img src="./media/board_setup.png" width="600">
</details>

Using the above image as reference, make the following connections:

1. Connect an Ethernet cable from your LAN (router/switch) to the Ethernet connector labeled **#1**. If you instead wish
   to use Wi-Fi, after booting your board refer to the [WIFI](WIFI.md) guide.
2. Connect a uvc-compliant webcam to the USB-A connector labeled **#4**.
3. Connect an HDMI cable from a monitor/display to the HDMI connector port labeled **#5**.
4. Lastly, connect the included USB cables from your PC to the USB-C connectors labeled **#2** and **#3** to power on
   the board.

# 4. Cloud Account Setup

An /IOTCONNECT account with AWS backend is required. If you need to create an account, a free trial subscription is
available.
The free subscription may be obtained directly from iotconnect.io or through the AWS Marketplace.

* Option #1 (
  Recommended) [/IOTCONNECT via AWS Marketplace](https://github.com/avnet-iotconnect/avnet-iotconnect.github.io/blob/main/documentation/iotconnect/subscription/iotconnect_aws_marketplace.md) -
  60 day trial; AWS account creation required
* Option #2 [/IOTCONNECT via iotconnect.io](https://subscription.iotconnect.io/subscribe?cloud=aws) - 30 day trial; no
  credit card required

> [!NOTE]
> Be sure to check any SPAM folder for the temporary password after registering.

# 5. Device Setup

1. Open a serial terminal emulator program such as TeraTerm.
2. Ensure that your serial settings in your terminal emulator are set to:

- Baud Rate: 115200
- Data Bits: 8
- Stop Bits: 1
- Parity: None

3. Starting with the lowest COM port value for "USB Serial Device" in the Device Manager list, attempt to connect to
   your board via the terminal emulator

> [!NOTE]
> A successful connection may result in just a blank terminal box. If you see a blank terminal box, press the ENTER key
> to get a login prompt. An unsuccessful connection attempt will usually result in an error window popping up.

4. When prompted for a login, type `root` followed by the ENTER key.
5. Run these commands to update the core board packages and install necessary /IOTCONNECT packages:

```
sudo apt-get update
```

```
python3 -m pip install iotconnect-sdk-lite requests
```

6. Run this command to create and move into a directory for your demo files:

```
mkdir -p /home/weston/demo && cd /home/weston/demo
```

> [!TIP]
> To gain access to "copy" and "paste" functions inside of a Putty terminal window, you can CTRL+RIGHTCLICK within the
> window to utilize a dropdown menu with these commands. This is very helpful for copying/pasting between your browser and
> the terminal.

From here, to onboard your device into /IOTCONNECT you have two options.

Option A is more automated but currently requires a Solution Key that must be requested from Avnet.

Option B is more manual but does not have that potential Solution Key obstacle.

## Option A: Onboard Device via REST API (Requires Solution Key)

1. Run this command to install the /IOTCONNECT REST API python module:

```
python3 -m pip install iotconnect-rest-api
```

2. Now run this command to protect your /IOTCONNECT credentials:

```
export HISTCONTROL=ignoreboth
```

3. Then run this /IOTCONNECT REST API CLI command (with your credentials substituted in) to log into your /IOTCONNECT
   account on the device:

```
iotconnect-cli configure -u my@email.com -p "MyPassword" --pf mypf --env myenv --skey=mysolutionkey
```

For example if these were your credentials:

* Email: `john.doe@gmail.com`
* Password: Abc123!
* Platform: aws
* Environment: technology
* Solution Key: AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz1234567890

Your login command would be:

```
iotconnect-cli configure -u john.doe@gmail.com -p "Abc123!" --pf aws --env technology --skey=AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz1234567890
```

You will see this output in the console if your login succeeded:

```
Logged in successfully.
```

4. Lastly, run this command to download and run the device setup script:

```
curl -sOJ 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/avnet-iotconnect/iotc-python-lite-sdk-demos/refs/heads/main/common/scripts/device-setup.py' && python3 device-setup.py
```

## Option B: Onboard Device via Online /IOTCONNECT Platform

1. In a web browser, navigate to console.iotconnect.io and log into your account.
2. In the blue toolbar on the left edge of the page, hover over the "processor" icon and then in the resulting dropdown
   select "Device."
3. Now in the resulting Device page, click on the "Templates" tab of the blue toolbar at the bottom of the screen.
4. Right-click and then click "save link as"
   on [this link to the default device template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/avnet-iotconnect/iotc-python-lite-sdk-demos/refs/heads/main/common/templates/plitedemo-template.json)
   to download the raw template file.
5. Back in the /IOTCONNECT browser tab, click on the "Create Template" button in the top-right of the screen.
6. Click on the "Import" button in the top-right of the resulting screen.
7. Select your downloaded copy of the plitedemo template from sub-step 4 and then click "save".
8. Click on the "Devices" tab of the blue toolbar at the bottom of the screen.
9. In the resulting page, click on the "Create Device" button in the top-right of the screen.
10. Customize the "Unique ID" and "Device Name" fields to your needs.
11. Select the most appropriate option for your device from the "Entity" dropdown (only for organization, does not
    affect connectivity).
12. Select "plitedemo" from the "Template" dropdown.
13. In the resulting "Device Certificate" field, make sure "Auto-generated" is selected.
14. Click the "Save and View" buton to go to the page for your new device.
15. Click on "Connection Info" on the right side of the device page above the processor icon.
16. In the resulting pop-up, click on the yellow/green certificate icon to download a zip file containing your device's
    certificates, and then close the pop-up.
17. Extract the zip folder and then rename the ```.pem``` file to ```device-pkey.pem``` and the ```.crt``` file to
    ```device-cert.crt```.
18. Still on your host machine, use this command within the unzipped certificates folder to convert the ```.crt``` file
    to another ```.pem``` file (application is expecting ```.pem``` files):

```
openssl x509 -in device-cert.crt -out device-cert.pem -outform PEM
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using a Windows host machine, this command is most easily performed via Git Bash. Using CMD or Powershell
> may require additional configuration of openssl.

19. Back in your device's page in /IOTCONNECT, click on the black/white/green paper-and-cog icon in the top-right of the
    device page (just above "Connection Info") to download your device's configuration file.
20. Using SCP (or WinSCP) copy these 3 files into the ```/home/weston/demo``` directory of your board:
    * device-cert.pem
    * device-pkey.pem
    * iotcDeviceConfig.json

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These files must be copied **individually** into the ```/home/weston/demo``` directory. They cannot be wrapped inside
> of another folder.

21. In the terminal of your board, navigate to the ```/home/weston/demo``` directory and then run this command to
    download the basic quickstart /IOTCONNECT application called ```app.py```:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/avnet-iotconnect/iotc-python-lite-sdk-demos/refs/heads/main/stm32mp157f-dk2/starter-demo/src/app.py -O app.py
```

# 6. Using the Demo

Run the basic demo with this command:

```
python3 app.py
```

> [!NOTE]
> Always make sure you are in the ```/home/weston/demo``` directory before running the demo. You can move to this
> directory with the command: ```cd /home/weston/demo```

View the random-integer telemetry data under the "Live Data" tab for your device on /IOTCONNECT.

# 7. EIQ Vison AI Driver Monitoring System Demo

After completing the basic demo setup, you will be able to perform an OTA update to automatically install and begin
running the EIQ Vision AI Driver Monitoring System Demo on your NXP i.MX 93. Refer
to [this guide](./dms-demo/README.md).

# 8. Troubleshooting

To return the board to an out-of-box state, refer to the [flashing.md](flashing.md) guide.
